## Experience Architecture

**Stage: 2**

### Motivation

Transforming users data into Experiences
that will be followed Caliper standard.

### Proposed solution

Users can add their jobs and skills related to these jobs, By
collection these data the system will generate Experience (Experience is badge but not certified by organization but it comes from user inputs)

### Illustrative examples

User `X` has a current job on his profile `Frontend Developer` with skills `[HTML, Css, Javascript]`, the system will generate non validated badge (Experience)

Badge name is `Frontend Developer`

Badge skills are `[HTML, Css, Javascript]`

### Benefits

- Tracking non validated badges
- Using these users events in Caliper Standard
